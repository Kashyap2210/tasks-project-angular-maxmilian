    <!-- Since the value is now stored in the signal we need to call it like a function -->
    <!-- when its called like a function then it activates the read method on that signal -->
    <!-- So whenever the signal value changes then the UI is updated accordingly -->

    <!-- <img [src]="imagePath" [alt]="selectedUser().name" /> -->
    <!-- Now we are using computed to compute a value from the signal -->
    <!-- So when we use a computed method what angular does is that it sets up a subscription -->
    <!-- Subscription listens to the signal that has been changing and automatically updates the necessary values -->
    <!-- So whenever the signal recieves new value angular will recompute the value of imagePath, i.e. one of the signals changes -->
    <!-- Underneath, computed also generates a signal to notify the change in the signal -->
    <img [src]="imagePath()" [alt]="selectedUser().name" />

    <span>{{ getSelectedUser().name }}</span>
